# Connect-4-Game

- Connect Four (also known as Connect 4, Four Up, Plot Four, Find Four, Captain's Mistress, Four in a Row, Drop Four, and Gravitrips in the Soviet Union) is a two-player connection rack game, in which the players choose a color and then take turns dropping colored tokens into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. 

- The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. 

- The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own tokens. 

- Connect Four is a solved game. 

- The first player can always win by playing the right moves.

- The game was first sold under the Connect Four trademark[10] by Milton Bradley in February 1974.
